# google_translate_hack
Use google translate API for free.

This is a hack from the days of 2012. I commited to develop a webservice that does language translation, thinking that i will be able to use Google translate.
Later I realized that the Translate APIs are not free and hence to build the commited project I explored into this.
The project demonstration went succesfully! 

Not sure if Google has fixed this since 2012, and I don't know if this hack works currently. 

The pdf should neverthless serve as an educational document for debugging AJAX requests, and making websites safer.
